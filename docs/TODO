Ideas :

1.Queues and Stacks:
Define abstract data types for queues and stacks, which are often used in various algorithms and applications. These structures can help users manage data in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) or last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.

2.Hash Tables:
A hash table structure simplifies key-value data storage and retrieval. Users can benefit from a well-designed hash table to create associative arrays or dictionaries.

3.Binary Trees:
Implement binary tree structures like binary search trees (BST) or balanced binary trees (e.g., AVL or Red-Black trees) for efficient data organization and searching.

4.Graphs:
Create a graph data structure to represent complex relationships between data points. Graphs can be used for a wide range of applications, such as network modeling and pathfinding algorithms.

5.Date and Time Structures:
Define structures for handling date and time, making it easier for users to work with timestamps and calendars.

6.Error Handling Mechanisms:
Create error handling structures, such as custom error codes or exception handling mechanisms, to improve code robustness and debugging.

7.Configuration Files:
Provide a structure and utility functions for reading and writing configuration files. This can be especially helpful for applications that require user-defined settings.

8.Buffers and Streams:
Define structures to manage input and output buffers or streams. These can help users read and write data efficiently, especially when working with files or network communication.

9.Memory Pools:
Implement memory pool structures to manage memory allocation and deallocation efficiently, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

10.Task or Thread Management:
Create structures to simplify multi-threading or task management, making it easier for users to write concurrent code.

11.Command Line Argument Parsing:
Develop a structure for parsing command line arguments and options, making it straightforward for users to configure and run programs from the command line.

12.Regular Expression Handling:
Offer a regular expression library or structure to facilitate text pattern matching and manipulation.

13.Data Serialization and Deserialization:
Create structures and functions for converting data to serialized formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and back, simplifying data storage and exchange.

14.Finite State Machines:
Provide structures for defining and managing finite state machines, which can be valuable in applications with complex logic and state transitions.
